Serialization: Converting data to bytestream to store in files, databases, persistent memory, pass around through networks
Deserialization: Converting bytes from files, databases, persistent memory, i/o from networks to bytestream to finally be converted to readable data

        Serialization                      Deserialization
 Data -> ByteStream -> Persistent Memory, 
                       Databases, 
                       Files, 
                       Networks ->         ByteStream -> Readable data
                       
  
Endianness: How data is stored in the memory.
Two types: Little Endian, Big Endian

Little Endian: The most significant bit of a number is stored in the largest memory address.

Big Endian: The most significant bit of a number is stored in the smallest memory address.

            Number (easy example: not accurate in terms of what actually happens as int is 4 bytes in Java)
            
            Memory address:      0x01 |0x02|0x03|0x04
            
            Little endian (1076)   6  | 7  | 0  |  1 |
            Big endian    (1076)   1  | 0  | 7  |  6 |
